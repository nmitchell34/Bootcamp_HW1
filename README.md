This project is called Code Refactor. The purpose of this project was to take a previously made webpage and update it to be more web accessible. This included changing html tags from non-semantic to semantic, maintaining a logical structure of html elements, a sequential order of heading tags, accessible alt attributes and a concise title. 

The only prerequisites to run this project should be the files present in the reposition. As long as the index.html file and the assets folder are in the same folder the web page should open appropriately.

Deployment has been done through github pages.

This project was built with HTML5, and CSS through Visual Studio Code.

Nicholas Mitchell was the only contributor to this project.
